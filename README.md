This is a firmware wich will turn ESP32 to a proxy remote control of a Roku TV in a Chrome browser tab on your PC (or MAC). Don't forget to replace port name in the upload script. In case of MAC you might need to give a permission to the script using this command: `sudo chmod 755 upload_macOS.sh`


This is more advance version of https://github.com/elshnkhll/RokuRC/tree/main/ESP_RokuRC_Proxy with faster TV (multiple Roku TV Sets) detection (in only 8 seconts). 

Works in tandem with second ESP32 chip as a Roku TV Private Listening proxy. (see https://github.com/elshnkhll/ROKU-TV-Private-Listening-ESP32)

After restart just navigate to http://rokurc.com/V2.1.php
